# Influenza-Like-Illness prediction

This project aims to implement a prediction model for Influenza-like illness in Italy.

## Brief history of the literature

Detecting epidemics using digital data is an hot topic in modern literature. For what regards influenza epidemics, the research paper ```"Detecting influenza epidemics using search engine query data" by Ginsberg, Mohebbi, Patel, Brammer, Smolinski & Brilliant``` published by Nature(2009) has been a milestone which brought the CDC to use Google FluTrend as gold standard for Influenza-Like Illness. All went good until ```"GFT overestimated the prevalence of flu in the 2012–2013 season and overshot the actual level in 2011–2012 by more than 50%"``` as Lazer, Kennedy, King, Vespignani reported in the article "The Parable of Google Flu: Traps in Big Data Analysis" on Science(2014). This thing pushed the research community to go further in the prediction analysis of Influenza-Like-Illness from digital data.


### Why influenza is important to estimate?

It could seem that in developed countries the influenza epidemics is well controlled but if we see the real data ```"Seasonal influenza epidemics result in an estimated 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and 250,000 to 500,000 deaths worldwide each year"``` from https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/influenza-(seasonal).


### General pattern for digital disease detection

1. Ground truth data from official source, this will be your gold standard.
2. Proxy data from digital source.
3. **Problem**: Predict ground truth data(target) from proxy data (features).
4. Train a statistical/learning model to solve the problem.
5. Validate model performance.


## Addressed problem: predict Influenza-like illness in Italy

1. Ground truth: The data comes from the epidemiologic surveillance by the ISS(**I**stituto **S**uperiore di **S**anità) on influenza. The data are available [here](https://old.iss.it/site/RMI/influnet/pagine/stagioni.aspx).
2. Proxy data: The digital data comes from the Wikipedia page view rate on pages related to Influenza. The data were scraped from the [PageView service](https://tools.wmflabs.org/pageviews/?project=it.wikipedia.org&platform=all-access&agent=user&range=all-time&pages=Influenza|Febbre) from the Wikimedia Toolforge.

The adopted methodology is inspired by the work ```D.J. McIver & J. S. Brownstein (2014), "Wikipedia Usage Estimates Prevalence of Influenza-Like Illness in the United States in Near Real-Time", PLoS Comput Biol 10(4): e1003581 http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003581```
